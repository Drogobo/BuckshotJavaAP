# Buckshot Roulette Written With AP Standards

This is an implementation of Buckshot Roulette that uses only the stuff allowed on the AP Java exams. Have fun in May and take a look at this project.

This project is also heavily commented. If you still need clarification on a certain part, feel free to open an issue or DM me on Discord: @drogobo

To begin the project, run main() in the Game class.
